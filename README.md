# Basic-FoodStore-App

Here  i used javascript , ejs, mongoDB, mongoose, express  and many more frameworks to create a 
functional FoodStore App . and yes i didn't used CSS so dont expect Styles.
I just created this to implemenyt CRUD operations on a FoodStore Database.

And yes i used mongodemon so that i dont have to restart my server over and over again after changes .
